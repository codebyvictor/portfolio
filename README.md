# Portfolio

## [1. Backtesting the Value at Risk using GARCH](https://github.com/codebyvictor/portfolio_optimization.git)
#### Tools used: R

This project centers on the backtesting of Value at Risk (VaR) measures for the S&P 500 and FTSE 100 financial indices using the GARCH(1,1)-Normal model. The approach entails computing log returns for these indices, estimating VaR using a static approach, then conducting a rolling window backtest. 

## [2. Risk Management: Valuation of an options portfolio using Black Scholes](https://github.com/codebyvictor/portfolio_optimization.git)
#### Tools used: R

This project involves the analysis and valuation of an options portfolio using historical data from the S&P 500 and VIX indices. The analysis includes the fitting of a volatility surface, pricing the options using the Black-Scholes model, and risk assessment through simulation techniques utilizing univariate and bivariate Gaussian models as well as a Student-t copula

## [3. Portfolio Management: Backtest portfolio strategies using multiple factor model](https://github.com/codebyvictor/portfolio_optimization.git)
#### Tools used: Python
This project aims to compute and backtest portfolio strategies using 4 industry characteristics: market capitalization, book-to-market ratio, momentum, market beta and idiosyncratic volatility. We assess the performance of these strategies using the Sharpe Ratio and the alphas derived from the Fama-French three-factor, four-factor, and five-factor models

## [4. Portfolio Optimization using a Resampled Efficient Frontier](https://github.com/codebyvictor/portfolio_optimization.git)
#### Tools used: Python
This project uses Markowitz' variance-covariance method to optimize asset allocation. In particular, we integrate Michaud's resampling efficient frontier to maximize the risk-return of the portfolio. 

This portfolio optimization technique was developed by Richard Michaud to address the limitations of the traditional mean-variance optimization approach. The method aims to create more stable and robust portfolios by incorporating statistical resampling techniques to account for the inherent uncertainty and estimation errors in the inputs (expected returns, variances, and covariances).

Linear constraints on the assets are added to the optimization problem.

## [5. Creating a Momentum Trading Strategy on Matlab / backtest](https://github.com/codebyvictor/Momentum-Trading-Strategy-on-Matlab.git)
#### Tools used: Matlab

The goal of this project is to calculate returns on a long-short momentum portfolio, using monthly data retrieved from the CRSP database from 2005 to 2009. Momentum is a trading strategy in which investors buy securities that are rising and sell them when they look to have peaked. The idea is to work with volatility by finding buying opportunities in short-term uptrends and then sell when the securities start to lose momentum. In this case, the loser portfolio is defined as securities where the yearly return is less than the 1st quantile and the winner portfolio is the one where the yearly return is larger than the 9th momentum quantile.

## [6. Creating a Mean-Reversion Trading Algorithm](https://github.com/codebyvictor/Mean-Reversion-Strategy.git)
#### Tools Used: Python (Jupyter Notebook), pandas, numpy, yfinance, beautifulsoup, matplotlib, seaborn, pushsafer

[![](/images/strategy-graph.png)](https://github.com/codebyvictor/Mean-Reversion-Strategy.git)

Mean-reversion strategies work on the assumption that there is an underlying stable trend in the price of an asset and prices fluctuate randomly around this trend. This means that a wide down movement below this trend will indicate a support level or buy signal and a big up movement will indicate a resistance level or sell signal.

## [7. Mixed Integer Programming to solve Supply-Demand Mismatch for Bike Sharing Service](https://github.com/codebyvictor/Rebalancing-Optimization-for-Bike-sharing-Systems.git)
#### Tools Used: Python (Jupyter Notebook), Gurobi for Programming, Numpy, MatplotLib

[![](/images/bixi.png)](https://github.com/codebyvictor/Rebalancing-Optimization-for-Bike-sharing-Systems.git)

Public bike sharing services often struggle with an imbalanced distribution of bikes among stations throughout the city. This is due to users following specific travel patterns for work, school, or other daily activities, causing high-traffic stations to become full and preventing other users from docking their bikes at their destination. The aim of the project was to create a model that recommends the optimal bike relocation strategy in the city, enabling more customers to use the service. To accomplish this, a mixed integer optimization model was developed to move bikes from low-demand stations to those with relatively higher demand.

## [8. Interactive Dashboard for Sports Management Company](https://github.com/codebyvictor/Hockey-Analytics.git)
#### Tools Used: Tableau, Excel

[![](/images/ckm.png)](https://github.com/codebyvictor/Hockey-Analytics.git)

This project employs Tableau to analyze a 7000+ hockey players dataset for CKM, a sports management company. The dashboard helps the company identify high-performing players across 34 hockey teams using boxplots, treemaps, bar charts, and graphs. Interactive filters were created for the company to set performance criteria when signing new players. The dashboard also enables easy retrieval of individual player information and provides an overview of averages. Custom KPIs, such as scoring accuracy and consistency, were added to enhance the analysis.

## [9. Sentiment Analysis of Fast Fashion Brands using Twitter Data](https://github.com/codebyvictor/Fashion-Industry-Sentiment-Analysis.git)
#### Tools Used: Python, Text Scraping, Find and Replace, Sentiment Analysis, Word Frequency, Excel

This project follows the story of a sport recruiter that makes use of data analytics to identify young athletes with high potential. The data regrouped more than 270,000 performances that occured in the Olympics up to 2016. This analysis highlights the importance of data analytics in fields such as sport management. Statistical techniques such as decision trees, multiple logistic regression, and random forests were used to find a model to make the most accurate predictions in future performances.

## [11. Building a 10,000 NFT Collection from scratch](https://github.com/codebyvictor/NFT-Collection.git)
#### Tools Used: Illustrator, Javascript

[![](/images/Website-screenshot.png)](https://github.com/codebyvictor/NFT-Collection.git)

Gaining more and more popularity, I decided to create my own collection of Non Fungible Tokens at the beginning of 2022, later developed on the Ethereum Blockchain. I used Adobe Illustrator to draw a first idea of my NFT and decided to make Snails the main concept of my collection. With the objective of creating more than 10k pieces of unique images, I first drew a combination of 5 to 20 images per layer (hats, accessories, colour, shirts, backgrounds...) and combined them with a Javascript program.

## [12. Social Media Analysis using Image Analytics and Topic Modeling](https://github.com/codebyvictor/Image-Analytics-on-Twitter.git)
